            <h2 id="gameinfoDrop">What is Rocket League?</h2>
            <h2 id="gameInfo">Rocket League is a fast-paced vehicular soccer game that combines the mechanics of driving with the strategy of traditional sports. Players control rocket-powered cars to hit a large ball into the opposing team’s goal, using flips, aerial maneuvers, and precise teamwork to outscore their opponents. The game is easy to pick up but incredibly difficult to master, with advanced mechanics like air dribbling, ceiling shots, and flip resets defining high-level play. Rocket League’s competitive scene thrives under the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS), where professional teams from around the world compete in high-stakes tournaments for massive prize pools. Its cross-platform accessibility and skill-based matchmaking make it one of the most balanced and exciting esports today.</h2>
