            <h2 id="gameinfoDrop">What is Super Smash Bros Ultimate?</h2>
            <h2 id="gameInfo">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a crossover fighting game that brings together characters from dozens of popular franchises, from Mario and Zelda to Pokémon and Sonic. Instead of reducing health bars, players aim to launch opponents off the stage using a mix of normal attacks, special moves, and items. Each fighter has a distinct playstyle and move set, encouraging both casual party fun and competitive mastery. The competitive Smash community is massive, with global tournaments like EVO and Genesis showcasing players’ technical skill in wave dashing, edge guarding, and combo chaining. The game’s unique blend of accessibility and depth has made it a cornerstone of both casual gaming gatherings and professional esports events.</h2>
