            <h2 id="gameinfoDrop">What is League Of Legends?</h2>
            <h2 id="gameInfo">League of Legends is a strategic, team-based multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) where two teams of five players compete to destroy each other’s Nexus, the core structure within their base. Players choose from over 160 champions, each with unique abilities and roles, and must coordinate tactics, control objectives, and outthink their opponents across three lanes and a sprawling jungle. The game demands quick decision-making, precise mechanical skill, and deep game knowledge. Its competitive scene is one of the largest in esports, headlined by the League of Legends World Championship — a global spectacle with millions of viewers and some of the most talented teams in gaming history. League’s mix of teamwork, strategy, and constant updates keeps it one of the most enduring and influential games of the modern era.</h2>
