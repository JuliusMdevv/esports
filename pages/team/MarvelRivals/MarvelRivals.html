            <h2 id="gameInfo">Marvel Rivals is a fast-paced, team-based hero shooter featuring iconic characters from the Marvel universe, such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Black Panther. Players form six-person teams and battle across dynamic maps using each hero’s distinct abilities, ultimate powers, and team synergies to secure objectives and outplay the opposition. The game emphasizes strategic hero selection and cooperative play, rewarding teams that coordinate their abilities for devastating combo attacks. As a newer title, Marvel Rivals has quickly gained traction in the competitive scene, with early tournaments and online leagues showcasing its potential as an emerging esport. Blending comic book flair with tactical shooter gameplay, it captures the excitement of Marvel battles while offering the depth and replayability competitive players crave.</h2>
